### 3. Webmapping concepts and tools:
* Tiling:
  * Examples:
	* [Bing Maps Tile System](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259689.aspx)
	* [MapTiler](http://www.maptiler.org/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/)
  * At the most zoomed out level (0), the whole world is a tile, and then, as you zoom in, that tile becomes four, and so on.
  * However, some parts of the world donâ€™t have the same resolution as others, and often, webmaps only allow limited zooming in in these parts.
* Projection:
  * Most of the platforms to do mapping online use a modified version of the Mercator projection. However, as we know, that projection has severe problems in terms of depicting areas at a large scale.
  * The two main reasons why they use it is that it works very well at a local (street) level, and it is computationally efficient in terms of zooming in and panning.
* Tools:
  * [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/gallery/): 'CartoDB is an open source tool that allows for the storage and visualization of geospatial data on the web.' Mostly used to upload and visualize geographic data. However, it has many advanced features. [Open source](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb).
  * [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/gallery/): 'Mapbox is a mapping platform for developers.' Mostly used to create base maps (tiles) and then overlay your data on top of them. [Open source](https://github.com/mapbox)
  * [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/): 'A modern map design platform.' This is now the platform where you create your *vector* tiles in Mapbox.
  * [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/): 'TileMill is the design studio to create stunning interactive maps.' **Deprecated** (no longer supported). TileMill is the program created by Mapbox where you used to create your *raster* tiles. It has been replaced by Mapbox Studio.
  * [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/): 'An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.' Leaflet is the most popular javascript library to create maps directly on your site (without embeding 'iframes' from CartoDB or Mapbox or others). [Open source](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet)
  * [Mapzen](https://mapzen.com/): 'Mapzen builds open-source mapping tools and collaborates on open geodata initiatives.' Multiple tools, from rendering OSM data tiles, to geocoding search service, to routing.
  * [Google Fusion Tables](https://sites.google.com/site/fusiontablestalks/stories): 'Fusion Tables is an experimental data visualization web application to gather, visualize, and share data tables.' Google tool to visualize and map data using Google Maps as the base layer.
  * [d3](https://d3js.org/): 'a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.' Used for data visualization and for mapping.

### 4. Tutorial
* Code snippets:
```CartoCSS
#mnmappluto_1{
  [zoom = 8]{
  polygon-fill: #FF6600;
  polygon-opacity: 0.7;
  line-color: #FFF;
  line-width: 0;
  line-opacity: 1;
  }
}
```
