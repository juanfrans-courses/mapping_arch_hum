## Notes - Web Mapping - Part 2 (11/02/2016)

### 1. Open a Mapbox account:
* Sing up [here](https://www.mapbox.com/)

### 2. Other
* Map critique (how did it go?)
* Tutorial deliverable: web version of the humanities dataset or the sound map
* Next classes:
  * December 9: lab work on final projects (make some progress, bring a rough draft of your presentations (placeholder slides) and some specific questions). Things should be almost done.
  * December 16: Final review (10 minutes with discussion). All formats are valid but have a specific reason for using them (web mapping, static maps, animations, etc).

### 3. Blog

### 4. Other CSR Tutorials
* You will find other CSR tutorials [here](https://github.com/mym2107/CSR-Conflict-Urbanism-Aleppo/tree/master/Tutorials). They deal mostly with building webmaps through Mapbox but they also have some HTML and CSS components. Make sure you check them out.

### 5. Bypassing Mapbox and Carto:
* Javascript:
  * Leaflet
  * Styling OSM vector data with Mapzen
  * D3
  * Combination of all of them

### 6. Overview of Mapbox
* [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/):
  * Is a modern design platform for managing your spatial data and creating custom map styles. Use Mapbox Studio to design a map to your exact specifications by using Mapbox-provided tilesets, uploading your own vector or raster data, adding custom fonts and images, or simply refining the built-in template map styles.
  * Browser application.
* [Mapbox Editor](https://www.mapbox.com/editor/#style):
  * Is an online interface where you can choose a Mapbox classic style as a basemap, drag and drop features, and share your project. Editor requires no coding skills and can be easily integrated into a web template. You can import GeoJSON, CSV, KML, or GPX files into Mapbox Editor. You can also export data in GeoJSON or KML format.
  * Browser application.
  * To customize the basemaps you need to use either Mapbox Studio or Mapbox Studio Classic.
* [Mapbox Studio Classic](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio-classic/#darwin):
  * Is a desktop application for designing world maps. It allows you to design maps by using vector tiles and CartoCSS. Mapbox Studio Classic allows you to upload your map directly to your Mapbox account and then use your map style with our Developer tools.
  * Desktop application.
  * Seems like it's being replaced by Mapbox Studio (web application).
* Terminology:
  * Tilesets: data sources, like vector tile datasets or raster images.
  * Layers: layers are representations of data, like symbols or polygon fills (they contain references to tilesets).
  * Styles: the combination of data sources and layers.
